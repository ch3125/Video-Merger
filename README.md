# Video-Merger
This is a linux Shell script to merge multiple videos files stored in a directory into a single video using ffmpeg.

when running the shell script, send the first arguments as follows-
1st argument- path to the directory containing the videos
2nd argument - the name you want to give the output file along with the format of video
example-
sh vdo2.sh /home/chhavi/vdos result.avi
